============

The `ftw.table` package provides a table generator utility, which generates a html
table out of a list of almost anything.

The Javascript, which will be registered, contains an extensible jQuery plugin.
Using the optional extJS addon enables features such as grouping, sorting, filtering
drag'n'drop ordering, checkboxes, etc.
